            <h1>Towards a Zero Electricity Bill</h1>
            <p>Sick of getting big power bills? You've replaced all the old bulbs with LEDs, got a new fridge and
                super-efficient heat pump and you're still paying around $1200 a year? Your next step is to let HT Green
                work with you to design and install a system that uses solar, wind or geothermal that's guaranteed to
                wipe that power bill for now and into the future.

            <img src="images/pv250.jpg" alt="solar" width="250" height="250">
            <p>Solar Photovoltaic systems have come of age. Installers now can guarantee reliable cost-free power to
                your home or business. ROI is now taking less time than ever thanks to the ever decreasing equipment
                costs and better technology. If you have battery storage such as a Tesla Powerwall or similar Lithium
                Ion chemistry solutions then you can take your savings even further. Call us now to discuss which
                solution is the best fit for your home.

            <h3>Geothermal</h3>
            <hr>
            <img src="images/geo250.jpg" alt="geothermal" width="250" height="250">
            <p>Energy from the earth. It sounds simple because it is. The earth is warmer than the air and we can use
                this to heat your home. HT Green can engineer a solution to fit your situation to give you free
                plentiful home warming energy year-round. Geothermal power is cost effective, reliable, and
                environmentally friendly, but has previously been geographically limited to areas near tectonic plate
                boundaries. Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the range and size of viable
                resources, especially for direct applications such as home heating. Geothermal wells tend to release
                greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth, but these emissions are much lower than those of
                conventional fossil fuels. As a result, geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate global
                warming if widely deployed instead of fossil fuels.

            <h3>Wind Turbines</h3>
            <hr>
            <img src="images/turbine250.jpg" alt="turbine" width="250" height="250">
            <p>If you have the space and the aspect, we have the know-how to engineer a wind turbine system that
                generates electricity when the wind blows. Team a wind turbine with a solar PV system and you increase
                your energy generation potential. New to wind power? HT Green can show you more about how a wind
                turbine works, the benefits of wind energy and how a wind turbine is installed. If you're not sure on
                the type of turbine you need, before you buy from us, contact one of our wind power experts for the
                right advice.
